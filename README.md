## Notes

### 12/1/2022 call:
- Look at diagnosis trends - foot sores, malnutrition,
- Foot cleanliness w/o shoes, socks, etc.
- Have there been any programs implemented in this time period that we can then look for an effect? Eg, giving out shoes/socks decreasing foot issues.
- Limitation: hospital data is just one piece of their overall care. Urgent care isn't usually available. Do we get ER data?
- Mental health, drug abuse, overdoses, drug-related illnesses
- "explore the relationship between mental health (and other) diagnoses and demographic variables"
- are there correlations w/ people with chronic mental health issues with specific kinds of additional diagnoses. or age or race
- predictive analytics - what can you anticipate providing for a homeless person presenting in the ER
- maybe it will help develop interventions - eg give out shoes/socks, help w/ med maintenance
- 2008-2014, so very old, no covid, but should still be directional w/ relevant patterns. Proof of concept.
